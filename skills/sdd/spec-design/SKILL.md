# Technical Design

<background_information>

- **Mission**: Generate comprehensive technical design document that translates requirements (WHAT) into architectural design (HOW)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All requirements mapped to technical components with clear interfaces
  - Appropriate architecture discovery and research completed
  - Research latest best practices and external dependencies
  - Design aligns with steering context and existing patterns
  - Discuss design with users for clarity and approval
  - Visual diagrams included for complex architectures

</background_information>

## Input

This skill expects:
1. **Feature name** (required): The feature directory name in `docs/tasks/`
2. **Auto-approve flag** (optional): `-y` to auto-approve the previous phase

If inputs were provided with this skill invocation, use them directly.
Otherwise, ask the user for the feature name.
If the auto-approve flag is not provided, default to interactive approval mode.

## Core Task

Understand requirements, research project architecture and the latest best practices.
Concretize the design through dialogue with users.
Write technical design document for the specified feature based on approved requirements.

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Resolve Spec Path

**Resolve Spec Path**: Look for the feature directory in `docs/tasks/todo/<feature-name>/` first, then `docs/tasks/done/<feature-name>/`. Use whichever exists. If neither exists, report an error.

### Step 1: Load Context

**Read all necessary context**:

- `{spec_path}/spec.json`, `requirements.md`, `design.md` (if exists)
- **Entire `docs/steering/` directory** for complete project memory
- `docs/settings/templates/specs/design.md` for document structure
- `docs/settings/rules/design-principles.md` for design principles
- `docs/settings/templates/specs/research.md` for discovery log structure

**Validate requirements approval**:

- If auto-approve flag was provided: Auto-approve requirements in spec.json
- Otherwise: Verify approval status (stop if unapproved, see Safety & Fallback)

### Step 2: Discovery & Analysis

**Critical: This phase ensures design is based on complete, accurate information.**

1. **Classify Feature Type**:
   - **New Feature** (greenfield) → Full discovery required
   - **Extension** (existing system) → Integration-focused discovery
   - **Simple Addition** (CRUD/UI) → Minimal or no discovery
   - **Complex Integration** → Comprehensive analysis required

2. **Execute Appropriate Discovery Process**:

   **For Complex/New Features**:
   - Read and execute `docs/settings/rules/design-discovery-full.md`
   - Conduct thorough research using WebSearch/WebFetch:
     - Latest architectural patterns and best practices
     - External dependency verification (APIs, libraries, versions, compatibility)
     - Official documentation, migration guides, known issues
     - Performance benchmarks and security considerations

   **For Extensions**:
   - Read and execute `docs/settings/rules/design-discovery-light.md`
   - Focus on integration points, existing patterns, compatibility
   - Use Grep to analyze existing codebase patterns

   **For Simple Additions**:
   - Skip formal discovery, quick pattern check only

3. **Retain Discovery Findings for Step 3**:

- External API contracts and constraints
- Technology decisions with rationale
- Existing patterns to follow or extend
- Integration points and dependencies
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Potential architecture patterns and boundary options (note details in `research.md`)
- Parallelization considerations for future tasks (capture dependencies in `research.md`)

4. **Persist Findings to Research Log**:

- Create or update `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/research.md` using the shared template
- Summarize discovery scope and key findings (Summary section)
- Record investigations in Research Log topics with sources and implications
- Document architecture pattern evaluation, design decisions, and risks using the template sections
- Use the language specified in spec.json when writing or updating `research.md`

### Step 3: Generate Design Document

1. **Load Design Template and Rules**:

- Read `docs/settings/templates/specs/design.md` for structure
- Read `docs/settings/rules/design-principles.md` for principles

2. **Generate Design Document**:

- **Follow specs/design.md template structure and generation instructions strictly**
- **Integrate all discovery findings**: Use researched information (APIs, patterns, technologies) throughout component definitions, architecture decisions, and integration points
- If existing design.md found in Step 1, use it as reference context (merge mode)
- Apply design rules: Type Safety, Visual Communication, Formal Tone
- Use language specified in spec.json
- Ensure sections reflect updated headings ("Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map", "Technology Stack & Alignment", "Components & Interface Contracts") and reference supporting details from `research.md`

3. **Update Metadata** in spec.json:

- Set `phase: "design-generated"`
- Set `approvals.design.generated: true, approved: false`
- Set `approvals.requirements.approved: true`
- Update `updated_at` timestamp

## Critical Constraints

- **Type Safety**:
  - Enforce strong typing aligned with the project's technology stack.
  - For statically typed languages, define explicit types/interfaces and avoid unsafe casts.
  - For TypeScript, never use `any`; prefer precise types and generics.
  - For dynamically typed languages, provide type hints/annotations where available (e.g., Python type hints) and validate inputs at boundaries.
  - Document public interfaces and contracts clearly to ensure cross-component type safety.
- **Latest Information**: Use WebSearch/WebFetch for external dependencies and best practices
- **Steering Alignment**: Respect existing architecture patterns from steering context
- **Template Adherence**: Follow specs/design.md template structure and generation instructions strictly
- **Design Focus**: Architecture and interfaces ONLY, no implementation code
- **Requirements Traceability IDs**: Use numeric requirement IDs only (e.g. "1.1", "1.2", "3.1", "3.3") exactly as defined in requirements.md. Do not invent new IDs or use alphabetic labels.

</instructions>

## Tool Guidance

- **Read first**: Load all context before taking action (specs, steering, templates, rules)
- **Research when uncertain**: Use WebSearch/WebFetch for external dependencies, APIs, and latest best practices
- **Analyze existing code**: Use Grep to find patterns and integration points in codebase
- **Write last**: Generate design.md only after all research and analysis complete

## Output Description

**Command execution output** (separate from design.md content):

Provide brief summary in the language specified in spec.json:

1. **Status**: Confirm design document generated at `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/design.md`
2. **Discovery Type**: Which discovery process was executed (full/light/minimal)
3. **Key Findings**: 2-3 critical insights from `research.md` that shaped the design
4. **Next Action**: Approval workflow guidance (see Safety & Fallback)
5. **Research Log**: Confirm `research.md` updated with latest decisions

**Format**: Concise Markdown (under 200 words) - this is the command output, NOT the design document itself

**Note**: The actual design document follows `docs/settings/templates/specs/design.md` structure.

## Safety & Fallback

### Error Scenarios

**Requirements Not Approved**:

- **Stop Execution**: Cannot proceed without approved requirements
- **User Message**: "Requirements not yet approved. Approval required before design generation."
- **Suggested Action**: "Run `/sdd-spec-design <feature-name> -y` to auto-approve requirements and proceed"

**Missing Requirements**:

- **Stop Execution**: Requirements document must exist
- **User Message**: "No requirements.md found at `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/requirements.md`"
- **Suggested Action**: "Run `/sdd-spec-requirements <feature-name>` to generate requirements first"

**Template Missing**:

- **User Message**: "Template file missing at `docs/settings/templates/specs/design.md`"
- **Suggested Action**: "Check repository setup or restore template file"
- **Fallback**: Use inline basic structure with warning

**Steering Context Missing**:

- **Warning**: "Steering directory empty or missing - design may not align with project standards"
- **Proceed**: Continue with generation but note limitation in output

**Discovery Complexity Unclear**:

- **Default**: Use full discovery process (`docs/settings/rules/design-discovery-full.md`)
- **Rationale**: Better to over-research than miss critical context
- **Invalid Requirement IDs**:
  - **Stop Execution**: If requirements.md is missing numeric IDs or uses non-numeric headings (for example, "Requirement A"), stop and instruct the user to fix requirements.md before continuing.

### Next Phase: Task Generation

**If Design Approved**:

- Review generated design at `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/design.md`
- **Optional**: Run `/sdd-validate-design <feature-name>` for interactive quality review
- Then `/sdd-spec-tasks <feature-name> -y` to generate implementation tasks

**If Modifications Needed**:

- Provide feedback and re-run `/sdd-spec-design <feature-name>`
- Existing design used as reference (merge mode)

**Note**: Design approval is mandatory before proceeding to task generation.
