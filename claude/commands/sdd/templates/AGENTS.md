# AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development

Spec Driven Development implementation on AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)

## Project Context

### Paths

- Steering: `docs/steering/`
- Specs: `docs/tasks/`

### Steering vs Specification

**Steering** (`docs/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context
**Specs** (`docs/tasks/`) - Formalize development process for individual features

### Active Specifications

- Check `docs/tasks/` for active specifications
- Use `/sdd:spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines

- Think in English, generate responses in {{DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_NAME}}. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).

## Minimal Workflow

- Phase 0 (optional): `/sdd:steering`, `/sdd:steering-custom`
- Phase 1 (Specification):
  - `/sdd:spec-init "description"`
  - `/sdd:spec-requirements {feature}`
  - `/sdd:validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)
  - `/sdd:spec-design {feature} [-y]`
  - `/sdd:validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)
  - `/sdd:spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`
- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/sdd:spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`
  - `/sdd:validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)
- Progress check: `/sdd:spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)

## Development Rules

- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track
- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/sdd:spec-status`
- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.

## Steering Configuration

- Load entire `docs/steering/` as project memory
- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Custom files are supported (managed via `/sdd:steering-custom`)
